# MEA_analysis
Source code for analyzing multi-electrode array signal

Code is consists of 2 parts: Analysis for spike/burst and analysis for LFP event
Before the analysis, you may export each MEA channel response as .csv, read files from MATLAB, and save the data as .mat

# Analysis for spike/burst detection
"MEA_sample_data.mat" is for spike detection
Run v220523_MEA_SpikeAnalysis.m to run the analysis

# Analysis for LFP event detection
"MEA_sample_data_for_LFPevent.mat" is for LFP event detection
Run v220523_MEA_LFPAnalysis.m
